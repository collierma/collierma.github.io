I am a researcher with multidisciplinary experience in robotics, biomedical device development, and tissue engineering.
My current research interests include *Human Robot Interaction*, *Assistive Robotics*, *Healthcare Robotics*, and *Machine Learning* (mainly deep RL). I am interested in using principles from human physiology and psychology with machine learning to improve assistive robotics.

I am currently pursuing two bachelor of science degrees (Electrical Engineering and Biomedical Engineering) at the [University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB)](http://www.uab.edu/home/).
During my time at UAB, I conducted three years of tissue engineering research and participated in two robotics summer research programs: Georgia Tech's 2017 [SURE Robotics program](http://sure.robotics.gatech.edu/) (in [Prof. Charlie Kemp's lab](http://pwp.gatech.edu/hrl/about/)) and Carnegie Mellon's 2018 [Robotics Institute Summer Scholars program](https://riss.ri.cmu.edu/) (in [Prof. Henny Admoni's lab](http://harp.ri.cmu.edu/)). Additionally, I was named a Goldwater Scholar in 2017.

After I earn both of my degrees in April of 2019, I intend to pursue my PhD. Ultimately, I want to pursue a career in research.
