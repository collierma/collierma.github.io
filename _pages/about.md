I am a researcher with multidisciplinary experience in robotics, biomedical device development, and tissue engineering.
My current research interests include *Human Robot Interaction*, *Assistive Robotics*, and *Healthcare Robotics*. I am interested in using principles from human physiology and psychology with machine learning to improve assistive robotics.

I am currently pursuing my Ph.D. in Robotics at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) where I conduct assistive robotics research in the [Human and Robot Partners Lab (HARP Lab)](http://harp.ri.cmu.edu/). In the spring of 2019, I was awarded the National Defense Science and Engineering Graduate Fellowship to fund my graduate education.

In 2019, I earned two bachelor of science degrees (Electrical Engineering and Biomedical Engineering) from the [University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB)](http://www.uab.edu/home/).
During my time at UAB, I conducted three years of tissue engineering research and participated in two robotics summer research programs: Georgia Tech's 2017 [SURE Robotics program](http://sure.robotics.gatech.edu/) (in [Prof. Charlie Kemp's lab](http://pwp.gatech.edu/hrl/about/)) and Carnegie Mellon's 2018 [Robotics Institute Summer Scholars program](https://riss.ri.cmu.edu/) (in Prof. Henny Admoni's lab (HARP Lab). Additionally, I was named a Goldwater Scholar in 2017.
