### Eye Gaze Behavior in Telemanipulation of a Multi-stage Task

*Carnegie Mellon -- June 2018 - present*

Individuals with motor disabilities can use assistive robotics to independently perform activities of daily living. Many of these activities, such as food preparation and dressing, are complex and represent numerous subtasks which can often be performed in a varity of sequences to successfullly achieve a person's overall goal.
Because different kinds of tasks require different types or levels of assistance, the variety of subtask sequences which the user can choose makes robotic assistance challenging to implement in a multi-stage task. However, a system that can anticipate the user's next intended subtask can optimize the assistance provided during a multi-stage task. Psychology research indicates that non-verbal communication, such as eye gaze, can provide clues about people's strategies and goals while they manipulate objects.
In this work, we investigate the use of eye gaze for user goal anticipation during the telemanipulation of a multi-stage taks.
